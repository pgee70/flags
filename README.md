# ISO 3166-1 Country flags of the world as a CSS sprite.
I wanted to use ISO 3166-1 two-letter country codes to view the country's flag as a CSS sprite.  I couldn't find a resource available, so I decided to make one.
Images come from wikipedia, see enc. script.  I used Fireworks CS6 to create flags.fw.png which was used to create flags.png and flags.css

If you need to worry about licencing, see wikipedia.

enjoy!
